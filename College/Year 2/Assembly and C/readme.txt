Porting the code


Invalid input had to be checked and upon bad input exit the program.
Reserving bytes for variables and setting a max input length ensure no bad inputs with the input checks.
Extra messages were made to be user instructions and for invalid input.
Conversion functions had to be made to change input from string to integer and then from integer to string 
to display the sums.
